A book club for Mario Maker. The idea is that once a week someone is arbitrarily assigned to create a Mario Maker level 
for the rest of the group. 

You can sign up to join by commenting in this thread: [`club#1`](https://github.com/mariomakerbookclub/club/issues/1), 
and Peril will automatically invite you to the org - giving you the chance to be the maker of the week but also giving 
you the chance to get notifications as each week happens.

All of the automation can be inspected at [`mariomakerbookclub/peril-settings`](https://github.com/mariomakerbookclub/peril-settings).


### Themes and Difficulty

Each week [a random gene](https://art-genome-project-24zfbjh7w.now.sh/?query=%7B%0A%20%20%23%20Get%20a%20random%20set%20of%20five%20genes%0A%09randomGenes(count%3A%205)%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%23%20Pull%20out%20their%20details%0A%20%20%20%20name%0A%20%20%20%20family%0A%20%20%20%20description%20%23%20in%20markdown%0A%20%20%7D%0A%7D) from Artsy's [Art Genome Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_Genome_Project) is given as a cue for your level. You can live up to it, or ignore the prompt as much as you want.

How you interpret is up to you, we're kinda making art for each other, but it'd be nice to have folks offer ideas and encouragement on how to work with the prompt. You don't need 
to create a [Kaizo level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizo_Mario_World), but maybe every now and again something hard 
could be fun.
