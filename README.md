A book club for Mario Maker. The idea is that once a week someone is arbitrarily assigned to create a Mario Maker level 
for the rest of the group. 

You can sign up to join by commenting in this thread: [`club#1`](https://github.com/mariomakerbookclub/club/issues/1), 
and Peril will automatically invite you to the org - giving you the chance to be the maker of the week but also giving 
you the chance to get notifications as each week happens.

All of the automation can be inspected at [`mariomakerbookclub/peril-settings`](https://github.com/mariomakerbookclub/peril-settings)
